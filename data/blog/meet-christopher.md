# Meet Christopher

Hey there! I’m Christopher Olsen. If you’ve landed here, you probably know me as someone who spends a lot of time at the intersection of biotech, software, and data. I’m usually buried in science and code, thinking through an analysis pipeline, or dreaming up a new way to make sense of messy life sciences data. This site is my place to share a bit more about who I am, what I’m building, and what keeps me curious.

## Who Am I, Anyway?

In short: I’m a scientist turned builder. I started out in the bench sciences, fascinated by how biology works at the molecular level. But over time, I found myself just as interested in the tools we use to study it—the software, the databases, the frameworks that let us ask sharper questions. That curiosity pulled me deeper into coding and biotech software development.

I’ve always had a thing for connecting dots. Whether that’s linking a drug candidate to its clinical history, mapping a disease to its standard of care, or building a pipeline that surfaces insights nobody thought to look for—I love turning raw information into something actionable.

## Family and Fun

When I’m not deep in code or analyzing biotech data, I spend time with my family—my parents, cousins, and half siblings, enjoying the everyday chaos and joys of life together. For fun, I’m all about staying active and trying new things: hiking, sailing, tennis, volleyball, rock climbing, skating—you name it. I also love more laid-back hobbies like video games and board games, which are great ways to unwind, challenge my mind, and connect with friends.

## Falling Into Biotech Software

These days, most of my projects live at the boundary of data science and biotechnology. I’ve built tools like **PlateMapper**, which allows for easy microtiter plate setup and tracking, and an **DoseResponse Analysis** for quickly analyzing diverse dose response data. I’m also working on other projects across the biotechnology space including a platform for LLM powered preclinical bench protocol design and management.

For me, building these systems is a bit like solving a giant, cross-disciplinary puzzle. I get the same rush from writing a clean query or mapping disease-drug relationships as I used to at the bench when an experiment finally worked.

## The Big Dream

Looking forward, I want to keep pushing at the frontier where biology and data meet. I see a future where biotech evaluation—funding, pipelines, science, and outcomes—is more transparent and more connected. My goal is to keep building frameworks that let scientists, investors, and patients make smarter decisions.

At the same time, I’d be lying if I said I didn’t also dream of a slower life one day—space to step back, work on personal projects, and live more deliberately. Until then, I’m sprinting where I can, creating tools that (hopefully) make a difference.

## Wrapping It Up

So that’s me, Christopher Olsen. A scientist, a coder, a builder, and someone who can’t resist digging into the technical rabbit holes of biotech. Thanks for stopping by—I’d love to connect, whether it’s about AI, life sciences, or swapping notes on building things from scratch.
