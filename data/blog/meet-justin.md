# Meet Justin

Hey there! I’m Justin P Barnett—welcome to my little corner of the internet. If you’re here, you probably know me as the VR dev guy who’s either coding up a storm, chasing adrenaline highs, or trying to keep up with a toddler (and soon, a newborn). I figured it’s about time I let you in on who I am beyond the YouTube videos and live streams. So, grab a coffee—or a VR headset if you’re feeling fancy—and let’s chat about me, myself, and my slightly chaotic life.

## Who Am I, Anyway?

In a nutshell, I’m an athletic nerd. Picture this: a kid who’s captain of every sports team he touches—soccer, football, you name it—mixed with the weirdo who’d rather build a website for a 5th-grade presentation than slap together a PowerPoint. That’s me. Growing up, I was dead-set on joining the military. I mean, it made sense—I’m an adrenaline junkie with a knack for high-stakes situations. But life had other plans. A shoulder injury from football (thanks, high school glory days) got me rejected, and suddenly I was staring down a different path.

Both my parents are software developers, so coding was basically in my DNA. I grew up in a house where debugging was dinner-table talk. After the military dream fizzled, I went and got myself a Bachelor’s in Software Engineering. Turns out, I’m pretty darn good at it—and I actually love it. Who knew?
Falling Down the VR Rabbit Hole

These days, I’m a software developer specializing in B2B VR applications. What’s that mean? I build virtual reality tools for businesses—think training simulations, interactive demos, that sort of thing. How’d I end up here? Well, I’ve always been a problem-solver. Coding feels like playing a real-time strategy game (which, by the way, I’m obsessed with in my free time). It’s all about cracking puzzles and outsmarting challenges—it’s my kind of fun.

VR specifically? That started about six or seven years ago when I strapped on a headset for the first time. It was one of those “holy crap, this is the future” moments. My programmer brain kicked into overdrive: How do I make stuff for this? Back then, online resources were pretty meh—just some dry documentation and not much else. So, I started tinkering, figuring things out, and—here’s where I probably sound like a dork—I made YouTube videos about every new trick I learned. A year of weekly uploads later, and bam, I had a channel and a community of aspiring VR devs growing around it. My most exciting project? Whatever I’m working on right now. I’m lucky enough to always be stoked about the latest gig.

## The YouTube Life and Teaching VR

Speaking of that YouTube channel—it’s kind of my baby. It kicked off as a selfish thing, really. I just wanted to document what I was learning since there wasn’t much out there for VR newbies. But then people started watching. Like, really watching. Now it’s this awesome hub where I teach others how to dive into VR development. Teaching’s a trip, man. There’s nothing cooler than seeing someone take what you’ve shared and run with it. It’s like passing the torch—except I’m still holding mine, too, because I’m not done yet.

I’ll be real, though—it’s not always easy to keep up. I burn hot and fast. When I’m into something (like VR or, heck, this blog post), I’m all in. I learn quick, I go hard, but if it stops being a challenge? My interest can fizzle. Keeping the channel and community consistent is a grind sometimes, but it’s worth it when I see the impact.
Family: The Heart of It All

Alright, let’s get personal. I’m married to Sav—short for Savannah, my rock and way better half. We’ve got a two-year-old tornado named Wesley, and come July, we’re adding a little girl to the mix. Family life’s wild, and balancing it with work and side hustles? Oof, it’s a juggling act I’m still figuring out.

I used to be an early bird—up at 4 or 5 a.m., grinding on VR stuff before Wes woke up. Lately, though, I’ve flipped to night-owl mode. After Wes crashes, I’ve got about two golden hours to stream or edit videos. The rest of my day? It’s the 9-to-5 gig and soaking up family time. Sav’s a saint for putting up with my weird hours, and Wes—well, he’s two, so he doesn’t care as long as I’m chasing him around or building block towers. The new baby’s gonna shake things up even more, but I’m stoked. Bring it on.

## Giving Back: Church, SAR, and Eagle Scout Vibes

Outside the code and family bubble, I’m big on community. Sav and I are part of New Life Canton, our local church—it’s our grounding spot. Then there’s my gig with the local Search and Rescue team, where I’m officially a volunteer firefighter. Why do it? Blame the Eagle Scout in me. Boy Scouts drilled community service into my skull, and I loved every minute of it—still do. SAR keeps my medical, survival, and outdoor skills sharp, plus it’s pretty much the only way I socialize these days. Nothing bonds you like trudging through the woods at 3 a.m. looking for a lost hiker, right?

## Chasing the Adrenaline High

If you haven’t caught on yet, I’m an adrenaline junkie. In my free time—when I’m not streaming VR dev sessions—I’m knee-deep in intense 40-hour military simulations a few times a year. Think hardcore strategy, survival, and a little chaos thrown in for fun. Why? I thrive in high-stress stuff. Coding live in front of dozens of people? Stakes are up, heart’s pumping—love it. The military sims? Same deal, just with more dirt and that Eagle Scout outdoorsy twist. It’s a rush, and I’m hooked.

Compared to VR work, it’s night and day but weirdly similar. VR’s all mental—solving problems in a digital sandbox. The sims are physical and raw, but both scratch that itch for a challenge. I guess I just can’t sit still.

## Growing Up the Oldest

Being the eldest of three—with two younger sisters—shaped me more than I realized. I was the guinea pig, you know? The one who had to figure stuff out first, set the example, all that jazz. It made me independent but also a little bossy (sorry, sis). I think it’s why I gravitate toward leadership roles—captaining sports teams, running a VR community, even wrangling Wes. It’s in my bones.

## The Surprise Self-Discovery

One thing I’ve learned about myself that caught me off guard? That whole “burn hot and fast” thing. Work, family, community—it’s all shown me I’m a sprinter, not a marathon runner. I’ll dive headfirst into something, master it quick, and then… huh, what’s next? It’s a blessing and a curse. Keeps me sharp, but consistency? That’s my kryptonite. Admitting that was a wake-up call—I’m still working on pacing myself.

## The Big Dream

Looking ahead, I’ve got this cheesy goal every developer secretly (or not so secretly) has: retire to a farm, build a self-reliant homestead, and just… chill. Picture me with a VR headset in one hand, a pitchfork in the other, coding whatever passion project I damn well please—maybe even a VR game I’ve been dreaming up. No deadlines, no clients, just me and my ideas. That’s the dream, anyway. We’ll see if I can slow down long enough to get there.

## A Nugget for VR Newbies

If you’re reading this and thinking about jumping into VR development—first, do it. Second, here’s my one piece of advice: start small, but start now. Don’t wait for the perfect tutorial or the fanciest gear. Grab a headset, mess around, break stuff, fix it. That’s how I learned, and it’s how you’ll figure it out too. Oh, and maybe check out my YouTube channel—I’ve got your back.

## Wrapping It Up

So, that’s me—Justin P Barnett. A coder, a teacher, a dad, a wannabe farmer, and a guy who can’t say no to a good adrenaline rush. Life’s messy, I’m far from perfect, and I’m probably over-caffeinated as I write this, but I wouldn’t trade it. Thanks for stopping by to get to know me—I hope we can connect more, whether it’s over VR, a military sim debrief, or just swapping stories about surviving toddler tantrums. Catch you on the flip side!

## Recent Circumstances

I was recently laid off of my job working at a startup called thinAiR that specialized in making VR training and sales applications. I got an invite that just said "Planning meeting" and when I joined I was told that the company had run out of money and that this would be our last paycheck. What's particularly devestating about all this is that it was a week before my second child is supposed to be born and I was expecting to be able to go on paternity leave for at least a month or so.
