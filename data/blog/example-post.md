# Building a Modern Portfolio Website

In this post, I'll share my experience building a modern portfolio website using Next.js, React, and TypeScript.

## Why Next.js?

Next.js provides an excellent developer experience with features like:
- Server-side rendering
- API routes
- File-based routing
- TypeScript support out of the box

## Key Features

1. **AI-Powered Chat**: Implemented using OpenAI's GPT-4 and vector embeddings
2. **Dark Mode**: Seamless theme switching with system preference detection
3. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach using Tailwind CSS

## Technical Implementation

The project uses several modern technologies and practices:
- Next.js 13+ with App Router
- TypeScript for type safety
- Supabase for authentication and database
- OpenAI for natural language processing

## Conclusion

Building this portfolio has been an exciting journey that showcases modern web development practices.
